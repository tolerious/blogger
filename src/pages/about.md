# About Me

Hello all, my Chinese name is 冯赫龙, and my English name is tolerious, pronounced as /təˈlaʊrɪs/ or /taʊlerɪs/, either is OK.

So what about the word `tolerious`  mean, it was invented by myself.

'`toler`' comes from the workd '`tolerance`', I think we need to be patient, kind, charitable, etc.

'`ious`'  means 'has the property of something'.

So in conclusion, the word '`tolerious`' represent that I want to be a kind and patient person.

I'm located in Shanghai, China.
